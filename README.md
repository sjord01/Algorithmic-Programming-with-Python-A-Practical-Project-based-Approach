# Algorithmic-Programming-with-Python-A-Practical-Project-based-Approach
The project is a series of liveProjects that teaches you how to use specific algorithms to solve important programming problems. It covers topics such as recursion, linked data structures, trees, network algorithms, and more. You'll gain practical experience with various algorithmic topics, data structures, and programming techniques in this series of projects. Overall, this project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of algorithms and their practical applications in programming.

## Trees
This series of project steps involve using Python and various algorithms to manipulate binary and N-ary trees. The focus will be on sorting data, as well as storing, finding, and removing data in sorted trees. Additionally, it explores different layout approaches for organizing charts. By the end of the project, a base for a production-ready project on manipulating trees in Python and creating effective organizational charts will be scripted.
