# Algorithmic-Programming-with-Python-A-Practical-Project-based-Approach
The project is a series of liveProjects that teaches you how to use specific algorithms to solve important programming problems. It covers topics such as recursion, linked data structures, trees, network algorithms, and more. You'll gain practical experience with various algorithmic topics, data structures, and programming techniques in this series of projects. Overall, this project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of algorithms and their practical applications in programming.

## Trees
This series of project steps involve using Python and various algorithms to manipulate binary and N-ary trees. The focus will be on sorting data, as well as storing, finding, and removing data in sorted trees. Additionally, it explores different layout approaches for organizing charts. By the end of the project, a base for a production-ready project on manipulating trees in Python and creating effective organizational charts will be scripted.

### Node Classes
The classes BinaryNode and NaryNode have variables that refer to other objects of the same class. For instance, a BinaryNode can have a maximum of two BinaryNode "children". The recursive structure of a tree is made possible by the fact that nodes can have children that are also node objects.

### Outline Views
This milestone showcases recursion, which is a crucial concept in trees. Additionally, it highlights the advantage of working with n-ary trees over binary ones, as an n-ary tree enables looping through a node's children, rather than dealing with each child individually. In fact, in certain scenarios, it might be more convenient to use an n-ary node class to represent a binary tree. However, some adjustments may be necessary to ensure that no node has more than two children in its children collection.
